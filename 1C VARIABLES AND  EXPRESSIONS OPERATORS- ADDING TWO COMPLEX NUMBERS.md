# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To Write a python program for floor division on the given values using // operator

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Read two integer inputs a and b from the user.
3. Perform the floor division of the two numbers using the `//` operator.
4. Print the output.
5. Terminate the program.
