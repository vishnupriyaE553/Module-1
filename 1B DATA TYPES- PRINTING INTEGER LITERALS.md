# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Printing Integer Literals

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the integer literals.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Accept an integer input from the user and store it in the variable men_stepped_on_the_moon.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the  value of men_stepped_on_the_moon.
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223060305
# Name-Vishnu Priya E
men_stepped_on_the_moon = int(input())
